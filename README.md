# New-Product-Demand-prediction
This project involves in predicting the demand for a product with new features based on the historical data of demand available for similar and currently existing products using Machine learning algorithms such as Clustering, Regression. The model further uses a method for computing an normalized innovation potential factor for the new feature. This innovation potential can be used to predict the change in sales that can occur because of the addition of the new feature.
